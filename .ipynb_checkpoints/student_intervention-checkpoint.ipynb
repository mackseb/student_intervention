In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "In order to assess good candidate models for the given problem, it is neccessary to analyze the structure of the dataset. In the first part of this notebook a data exploration has been performed with two main outcomes:\n",
    "1. The total number of data points (395) is comparably low in relation to the number of features (31)\n",
    "2. The dataset has more data points of students who passed than students who failed (ratio 0.64)\n",

    "In the field of computational biology, the protein remote homology detection is a common problem. The most effective method to solve this problem is using SVM. In last few years, SVM algorithms have been extensively applied for protein remote homology detection.\n",
    "2. Strengths / good performance:\n",
    "    - Effective in high dimensional spaces\n",
    "    - Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples\n",
    "    - Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (support vectors), so it is also memory efficient\n",
    "    - Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function\n",
    "3. Weaknesses / bad performance:\n",
    "    - If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial\n",
    "    - SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation\n",

    "    - Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.\n",

    "For this specific problem I would suggest to the board of supervisors to use a knn classifier model for implemtation. Although it does not provide the best testing score of the experiments that have been performed, it offers other benefits that outweigh this small disadvantage. In addition after fine tuning the knn model it should be able to achieve comparable scores on the testing set as other suggested models. As already described, the dataset is small with many features and also slightly unbalanced which can be handled well by a knn model. The main advantage of this model over the other is its inherit property of not requiring lots of computational recources for training since it is a learning method in which generalization of the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system. It also has the advantage that new training data points can be integrated quite easily and do not require recomputation."

    "The knn classifier is a really simple machine learning model which can be categorized as a lazy learning method. Although its core idea is quite simplistic, it can be applied to variety of problems achieving reasonable results.  \n",
    "Comparable to a lazy student in school that does not want to learn for an exam and writes all the material from the lessons on some cheat sheets, the knn model also makes a kind of cheat sheet and remembers the entire dataset in its memory. In case of questions or queries the student/model just needs to take a look to the cheat sheet and find the entry that is nearest to the input. One disadvantage of this method is clear, it lacks of generalization.\n"
